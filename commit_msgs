feat(installer): Translate script to English and update documentation

Translates the entire installer script (`installer_en.py`) from Arabic to English. This includes all comments, docstrings, logging messages, and user-facing print statements to improve code maintainability and accessibility.

- All hardcoded Arabic strings are replaced with English equivalents.
- Log outputs and console messages are now in English.

docs: Update README.md with comprehensive project structure, interactive usage guide, and examples of how to use the `firewall` package as a library.
